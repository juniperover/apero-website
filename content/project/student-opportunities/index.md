### Join an existing project

I have many active projects, as well as some ideas that I haven't had time or help to develop. The latter include
- How does status affect whether someone can exclude others?
- Is power a solution to the tradeoff between freedom and relatedness?
- How does destabilisation of job opportunities in one's local region predict compensatory power behaviours?
- Are cultural logics really lay theories of how power works?
- Several more!

### Propose your own idea

Please be sure to read my work and review current projects and talks to be sure that your interests have some degree of overlap with mine. I am open to diverse ideas and working with independent-minded students...as long as there's good fit between us!
