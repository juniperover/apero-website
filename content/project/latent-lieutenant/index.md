excerpt: "In multiple studies, we've shown that a potential leader is seen as more powerful, more competent, and sometimes even more likable, based on the subtle nonverbal responses of **other** people around them."

#### Why the thumbnail image on the projects page?

The image is a screengrab from an [influential TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement) that Derek Sivers gave several years ago--it inspired this work, and though his thesis is different, his advice is very consistent with our findings in this project!
