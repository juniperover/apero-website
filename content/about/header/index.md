**What Makes Me Tick.** Since my earliest days of doctoral study at the [University of Colorado at Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/psych-neuro/), I've been fascinated by power, status, and hierarchy. Later, I added negotiations and change to the mix. Some themes of my work include the active strategies that people use to manage their own and othersâ€™ hierarchical position in groups; how we assign status to others; how to drive change more effectively from non-powerful positions; and how to improve negotiation outcomes. 

Throughout my work, I strive to help participants make processes more rational, interactions more cordial, and organisations more humane. 

<!-- My current projects examine how status makes us feel safer; the hedonic (pleasure) versus eudaimonic (meaning) motives that drive people to seek power; people's "lay theories" of power as more coercive or collaborative. -->
