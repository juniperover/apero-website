### Do you want better insight into the human side of your organisation?

I am consistently looking for opportunities to study aspects of organisational functioning, such as:

- What is the power and influence culture of the organisation?
- Are people using power in constructive ways?
- Do we find patterns where one unhealthy leader can 'infect' the larger culture?
- How can we coach unhealthy leaders to be more constructive and collaborative?
- How effectively do organisation members influence others?
- Can we improve receptivity to organisational changes?
    
In exchange for access to your organisation (this could include running surveys or interviews, observing meetings, or reviewing records or correspondence) I am happy to feed back findings to leadership* and/or to collect additional data about issues of critical concern to leadership.

Please note that a partnership agreement will include confidentiality protections, though it must also guarantee my ability to publish findings.

*Please note, as well, that any agreements must abide by my [ethical code of conduct](/blog/2021-07-28-ethical-code/).
