Please note that this survey has not gone through ethics review for human subjects research. It is not currently my intention to use this for published research, but rather to inform my teaching and training, and as background to plan future research.

It's conceivable that at some future time I'll see ethics approval to use already-collected data. If you prefer that I NOT use your anonymous data in published research then please [send me an email](mailto:j.overbeck@mbs.edu) with the time and date you completed the survey, as well as your computer's location when you did it. This will allow me to find and delete your data record without collecting identifying information.
