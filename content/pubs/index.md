### [*Silence is golden: Extended silence, deliberative mindset, and value creation in negotiation*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3740110)
Curhan, J. R., Overbeck, J. R., Cho, Y., Zhang, T., Yang, Y. (in press). Silence is golden: Extended silence, deliberative mindset, and value creation in negotiation. *Journal of Applied Psychology*.

We examine the previously unstudied effects of silent pauses in bilateral negotiations. Two theoretical perspectives are tested—(1) an internal reflection perspective, whereby silence leads to a deliberative mindset, which in turn prompts value creation, and (2) a social perception perspective, whereby silence leads to intimidation and value claiming. Study 1 reveals a direct correlation between naturally-occurring silent pauses lasting at least 3 seconds (extended silence) and value creation behaviors and outcomes. Study 2 shows that instructing one or both parties to use extended silence leads to value creation. Additional studies establish a mechanism for this effect, whereby negotiators who use extended silence show evidence of greater deliberative mindset (Study 3) and a reduction in fixed-pie perceptions (Study 4), both of which are associated with value creation. Taken together, our findings are consistent with the internal reflection perspective, whereby extended silence increases value creation by interrupting default, fixed-pie thinking and fostering a more deliberative mindset. Findings of Study 3 also suggest a boundary condition whereby when status differences are salient, the use of silence by higher-status parties leads to value creation, whereas the use of silence by lower-status parties does not. Finally, Study 4 shows that instructing negotiators to use silence is more effective for value creation than instructing them to problem-solve. Challenging the social perception perspective that silence is a form of intimidation, we find no evidence for any associations between extended silence and the proportion of value claimed or subjective value of the counterpart. 

### [*The effects of experience, expertise, reward power, and decision power in groups*](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-60303-001)

Bonner, B. L., Soderberg, A. T., Meikle, N., & Overbeck, J. R. The effects of experience, expertise, reward power, and decision power in groups. *Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice*.

Introduction: Group members influence one another’s thinking in virtually every context, yet little research addresses how different combinations of experience, expertise, and power affect group dynamics and outcomes. Combining theory on social hierarchy and group decision-making, we offer a more comprehensive perspective. Method: Participants (N = 360) completed estimation tasks individually and then again in a face-to-face group using a multiphase design. Intragroup influence and task performance were measured. Results: When a group member was perceived to have relevant experience, group decisions were weighted toward her preferences. When someone in the group held decision or reward power, group decisions were instead weighted toward the preferences of the member with the most expertise. Reward power led to superior group performance. Discussion: This research highlights the importance of understanding how group members respond to different forms of influence within groups.

### [*Interpersonal dynamics of nonverbal behavior in mixed-gender negotiations*](https://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788976756/9781788976756.00022.xml)

Wareham, J., & Overbeck, J. R. (2020). The unspoken language of power: Interpersonal dynamics of nonverbal behavior in mixed-gender negotiations. In J. Kennedy & M. Olekalns (Eds.), Handbook on Gender and Negotiation. Edward Elgar Publishing.

Nonverbal communication is an integral component of how individuals search for information to understand others’ interests, goals and intentions. Recent research on the intersection between gender and nonverbal behavior has investigated gender differences in both the display (e.g., expressiveness, valence and intensity) and decoding (e.g., sensitivity and accuracy) of nonverbal cues. A more deliberate focus on the nonverbal dynamics related to power, particularly those in mixed-gender dyadic negotiations, has the potential to inform multiple theoretical perspectives on gender differences in negotiation processes, performance, and outcomes. To this end, we offer a fresh perspective on the nonverbal dynamics pertinent to mixed-gender negotiations. In our chapter, we examine convergence among theories in social relations and negotiations research, review empirical literature on key interpersonal factors influencing dyadic social interactions (i.e., power, trust and gender), and document how many of the observed patterns of gender differences in nonverbal behavior map directly onto and correspond with power differences in nonverbal cues. Furthermore, we develop theoretical propositions expanding on what we view as three fundamental interpersonal properties of nonverbal cues, including mode (e.g., implicit vs explicit), intent (e.g., spontaneous vs strategic), and consequence (e.g., competitive vs cooperative). Our goal is to advance research, theory and conceptual integration at the nexus of gender and negotiation to provide a foundation and agenda for future research.

### [*The leaders' rosy halo: Why do we give powerholders the benefit of the doubt?*](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pamela-Smith-13/publication/260714548_The_leaders'_rosy_halo_Why_do_we_give_powerholders_the_benefit_of_the_doubt/links/00b7d532106c34f2b6000000/The-leaders-rosy-halo-Why-do-we-give-powerholders-the-benefit-of-the-doubt.pdf)

In Van Prooijen, J. W., & Van Lange, P. A. (Eds), *Power, politics, and paranoia: Why people are suspicious of their leaders*. Cambridge University Press.

In the present chapter, we begin by examining powerholders themselves, detailing the multiple possible origins of the idea that power corrupts and discussing research that suggests a more nuanced view. Then we shift focus to perceivers, first acknowledging ways in which perceptual patterns may foster associations between power and corruption and then presenting data showing that people might instead have a positive view of those in power as a default.We review several reasons why such a positive view is likely to be far more prevalent than is generally recognized. Finally, we discuss implications of this “leaders’ rosy halo” for both theorizing about power and real-life hierarchies.


### [*One for all: Social power increases self-anchoring of traits, attitudes, and emotions*](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.953.9596&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

Overbeck, J. R., & Droutman, V. (2013). One for all: Social power increases self-anchoring of traits, attitudes, and emotions. *Psychological Science, 24*(8), 1466-1476.

We argue that powerful people tend to engage in social projection. Specifically, they self-anchor: They use the self as a reference point when judging others’ internal states. In Study 1, which used a reaction-time paradigm, powerful people used their own traits as a reference when assessing the traits of group members, classifying group descriptors more quickly if they had previously reported that those terms described themselves. Study 2, which used a classic false-consensus paradigm, showed that powerful people believed that their group-related attitudes were shared by group members. Study 3 showed that more-powerful people relied more on their own state affect when judging other people’s ambiguous emotional expressions. These results support our argument that power fosters self-anchoring, because powerful individuals are often called on to act as the representative face of their groups, and the association between power and representation prompts the heuristic use of the self to infer group properties.



### [*Power, status, and influence in negotiation*](https://www.elgaronline.com/downloadpdf/edcoll/9781781005897/9781781005897.00015.pdf)

Overbeck, J. R., & Kim, Y. K. (2013). Power, status, and influence in negotiation. In M. Olekalns & W. L. Adair (Eds.), *Handbook of Research on Negotiation*. Edward Elgar Publishing.

Negotiation is a process in which two or more people must reach agreement on how to divide some resource, when they have different preferences for how to do so. Given this, it is no surprise that influence is a fundamental element of negotiation, nor that both parties tend to want and seek influence over the counterpart in negotiation. This chapter will focus on two primary sources of influence: power and status. Power is a source of influence from objective, structural sources such as possession of resources or position in networks of relationships; status is a source of influence stemming from others’ consensual judgments (Fiske and Berdahl, 2007; Fragale et al., 2011). Though power has (and will be) the focus of work on influence in negotiation, both are important and both are considered here.
