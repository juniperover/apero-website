title: "Dissociative Status"
subtitle: "Status can be grabbed (the dominance pathway) or granted (the prestige pathway). And sometimes it's granted to those who signal social distance between themselves and others."
excerpt: "This set of multiple studies has shown that people willingly confer status onto others who show *defiance* or *exclusivity*--qualities not normally considered part of the prestige pathway to status."

### Survey Studies

Status is typically awarded to people who show two key qualities: *competence* and *willingness to contribute to the group*. Scholars assume that anyone not showing these qualities is pursuing status through a dominance strategy--seizing status through force and fear. We demonstrate another viable path: People can inspire others to willingly grant them status (commonly called the *prestige pathway*) by displaying **dissociative** cues, such as defiance or exclusivity.

We've conducted online studies where participants rate others.
