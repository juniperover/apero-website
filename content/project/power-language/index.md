title: "Power & Language"
subtitle: "Does power have a linguistic signature? And do listeners or readers infer someone's power based on use of such signatures?"
excerpt: "In this project with Robert Koerner (Bamberg Uni, Germany), we use natural language processing to identify how people signal their power through language use and how others pick up on these signals. We also examine how different use of power--coercive or collaborative--is conveyed in political communications."

### Study 1

Key themes: Speakers convey power; listeners and readers perceive it. Do speakers use identifiable language patterns? Do receivers use those patterns accurately and understand how powerful the speaker is?

### Study 2

Key themes: Politicians convey their "theory of power" through their speech. Using ten Brinke and Keltner's (2020) *lay theories of power*, Russell's (1938) *naked power* and *traditional power*, and the *prestige-dominance framework* (Henrich & Gil-White, 2001), we examine how the language use of US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Joe Biden differed during the 2020 election.
