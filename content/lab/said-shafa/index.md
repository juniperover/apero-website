My research focuses on the influence of personal and cultural values on processes and outcomes in social interactions. These processes are highly relevant to an organizational context but may also occur in other community settings, including benevolence and cooperation, conflict management and resolution, negotiation, and ethical decision making. For example, why do conflicts escalate differently across cultures and what are potential ways to resolve them? What are effective ways to develop trust and cooperation and how do cultures differ? How do personal or situational characteristics foster unethical behaviour? Of interest to my research are self-regulatory processes (including self-perceptions and self-worth), trust development, emotions (such as anger and shame), as well as their impact on psychophysiological (threat vs. challenge) and behavioural outcomes (cooperation, sharing of resources, aggression).
