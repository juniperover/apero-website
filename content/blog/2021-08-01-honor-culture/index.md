subtitle: "Power and honor culture in the BBC drama *Time*."
excerpt: "A scene in the BBC drama [Time]() shows a restorative justice meeting between a convicted murderer and his victim's parents; it ends with the mother declaring that, because of the motive, the crime is 'unforgiveable.' This judgment reflects a gap between her dignity-culture logic and his honor logic."

The new BBC short-run series [Time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p09fs2qh/time) [^1] is a dark, painful, and compassionate look at aspects of life in prison. In the first episode, one of the significant scenes showed Daniel, convicted of murder, meeting with the parents of the young man he had killed. The parents wanted to forgive despite their grief and anger; more than that, they wanted to understand why Daniel had killed their son Gerard.

[^1]: Sorry that the show can only be viewed at that link from the UK! We paid for a one-off viewing through Fetch here in Australia.

The story Daniel tells them is heartbreaking (SPOILERS FOLLOW). He was shouting drinks for his friends at a pub; when the bartender put three beers on the bar, Daniel picked them up to carry back to his table, taking a quick sip of one. Only it was the wrong order: Those three beers were for another group, and now they insisted that Daniel buy a replacement for the beer he'd sipped from. Daniel had only Â£1.20 left and was ashamed, so he refused. One of the men in the other group--Gerard--challenged him to pay or else 'settle things outside.' Gerard was about Daniel's size; Daniel reckoned they would go exchange some punches and put the whole thing behind them. 

What he didn't know was that Gerard was a boxer, and the fight was more of a beatdown. Finally, desperate, hoping to stop the assault, Daniel pulled out a knife. He wasn't thinking rationally, of course, but he hoped that it would make Gerard back down. It didn't. And he could have backed down. But he was ashamed again. And then Gerard was dead.

The parents listen to all of this with agonized expressions. Finally, Gerard's mother says, "You did all of this to avoid losing face." Daniel nods. "That's unforgiveable," she says.
