I will use rigorous methods and abide by up-to-date principles of research practice.

I will be transparent about the access I need and what I plan to do with it.

I will deliver written reports and/or presentations, per agreement, at the promised times. If delay is necessary, I will clearly explain why.

{{< panel name="What I won't do" >}}

I won't violate confidentiality agreements.

I won't "spy" on employees; anything they tell me will remain confidential and can only be revealed to organisational leadership in aggregate form (i.e., combined with other responses in a way where one person cannot be identified). 

I won't use measures or instruments that are trendy or popular unless they are also valid and fit-for-purpose.

I won't waste people's time or organisation resources by doing work that's unimportant or impractical.

{{< /panel >}}
{{< panel name="Who I'll work with" >}}

I am particularly interested in working with government, nonprofits, police and military.

Beyond these, I have consulting and training experience in healthcare, law, banking/insurance, energy, and construction.

I will generally not work with gambling companies or mining companies.

Projects with oil and gas or defence industry companies are considered case by case.
